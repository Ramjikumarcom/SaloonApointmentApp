🔐 Keycloak Integration in Spring Boot – For Saloon Appointment Project
📘 What is Keycloak?
Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) tool that provides:

Authentication (Login/Logout)

Authorization (Role-based access)

Single Sign-On (SSO)

User and Role Management

Token-based Security using OAuth2 / OpenID Connect / JWT

Integration with LDAP, Social Login (Google, Facebook, etc.)




 Why Use Keycloak in Spring Boot?
Spring Boot applications often require secure authentication and role-based access control. Instead of manually coding security using Spring Security and JWT, Keycloak provides a ready-to-use system to:

Authenticate users (login)

Authorize users (roles, access control)

Protect REST APIs and microservices

Integrate easily with React frontend
